# JS Advanced - Movable objects

This project was made as my answer to my first JS Advanved task at KodeHode by JobLoop.

## Overview

### The challenge

In this assignment, we will explore the practical side of JavaScript by creating a movable HTML element. The task is to enable the element to move freely around the browser window. The specifications are as follows:

Users should be able to:

- Navigation with arrow keys: Implement the ability to move the element in four directions – up, down, left, and right – using the arrow keys.
- Click to position: Allow the user to move the element directly by clicking anywhere on the page.
- Stay visible: Ensure that the element stays within the visible screen area.

### Optional Challenge

You can enhance your implementation with the following additions:

- Implement collision detection or add obstacles for added complexity.
